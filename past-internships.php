        It was indeed a great success. Mark Esssien born and raised in Ikot
        Ekpene, founder of hotels.ng along with Neo the CTO of the company
        came up with an idea of an internship program for software developers
        and put out a tweet. So many people applied, more than hundreds. He
        was convinced that people wanted to learn software development and
        so he went ahead with the plan. Well they decided they would pay but
        how were the going to do this? It was indeed a tough decision. They
        came up with an idea that it was going to be a remote internship,
        anybody could join but only those who deliver features in the course of
        the internship would get paid and they went on with the plan.
        Assignments were given stage by stage which includes;
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Setup git and pull and push some code which left only 80 people in the program. </li>
        <li>Write a bit of code (front-end mostly) and push to the repository and only 30 people were left</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There and then, the internship started in earnest. The Interns were
        given tasks, and each week they had to deliver whatever they were
        given. Those who delivered got paid while those who did not didn’t get
        paid following the plan.
        As weeks passed, people started leaving slowly reasons being that
        some could not meet up, and some because other things got in their
        way. But the determined ones still persisted all the way through to the
        end. 15 interns finished successfully. They did all their best just to
        complete it even when the circumstances became tougher.
    </p>

    <p>Finally they built 4 products for HNG which includes - Spots.ng (a listing
        of places in Nigeria), Raven (an internal email sending tool), Locations
        API (an API for Nigerian addressing system), and a yet to be released
        (Hotels.ng for Businesses).
    </p>

    <p>Three people were hired- Stephen Afam-Osmene (who started
        university at 14), Gideon Onwuka (a quiet guy who hardly said anything,
        but always was first in completing the tasks), and Fisayo Afoloyan (one
        of the few guys that was as good on the front-end as on the backend.
        It was really indeed a great success. They were picked up, they trained
        themselves and now they making the world a better place.
        Due to the success of HNG 1.0, HNG 2.0 has been setup to develop
        more people in software. Remember, it is still a remote internship and
        everyone is welcome. Anticipate powerfully and watch out for this
        year’s great software developers….you don’t want to be left out.
