            Due to the success of HNG 1.0, HNG 2.0 has been setup to develop
            more people in software. Remember, it is still a remote internship and
            everyone is welcome. Anticipate powerfully and watch out for this
            year’s great software developers….you don’t want to be left out.

        It was indeed a great success. Mark Esssien born and raised in Ikot
        Ekpene, founder of hotels.ng along with Neo the CTO of the company
        came up with an idea of an internship program for software developers
        and put out a tweet. So many people applied, more than hundreds. He
        was convinced that people wanted to learn software development and
        so he went ahead with the plan. Well they decided they would pay but
        how were the going to do this? It was indeed a tough decision. They
        came up with an idea that it was going to be a remote internship,
        anybody could join but only those who deliver features in the course of
        the internship would get paid and they went on with the plan.
        Assignments were given stage by stage which includes;
        1. Setup git and pull and push some code which left only 80 people in
        the program.
        2. Write a bit of code (front-end mostly) and push to the repository and
        only 30 people were left.
        There and then, the internship started in earnest. The Interns were
        given tasks, and each week they had to deliver whatever they were
        given. Those who delivered got paid while those who did not didn’t get
        paid following the plan.
        As weeks passed, people started leaving slowly reasons being that
        some could not meet up, and some because other things got in their
        way. But the determined ones still persisted all the way through to the
        end. 15 interns finished successfully. They did all their best just to
        complete it even when the circumstances became tougher.

        Finally they built 4 products for HNG which includes - Spots.ng (a listing
        of places in Nigeria), Raven (an internal email sending tool), Locations
        API (an API for Nigerian addressing system), and a yet to be released
        (Hotels.ng for Businesses).

        Three people were hired- Stephen Afam-Osmene (who started
        university at 14), Gideon Onwuka (a quiet guy who hardly said anything,
        but always was first in completing the tasks), and Fisayo Afoloyan (one
        of the few guys that was as good on the front-end as on the backend.
        It was really indeed a great success. They were picked up, they trained
        themselves and now they making the world a better place.

    <h2 id="hng-2" class="team7-heading-style">HNG Internship 2.0</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="team7-read-full">
        In a tweet on the 3rd of January, 2017, the CEO of <a href="http://www.hotels.ng">Hotels.ng</a> hinted at the commencement of the
        second edition of the <a href="http://www.internship.hotels.ng">Hotels.ng remote internship programme</a>, raising a glimmer of hope for the
        adoption of the internship programme as a tradition.
        Hotels.ng partnered with Start Innovation Hub, an Akwa Ibom based IT company, to bring to
        success the second edition of the remote internship programme tagged “Hotels.ng Software
        Developers Internship Programme.” HNG’s remote internship 2.0, as it is otherwise called, was
        open to 500 interns, and it was expected to be bigger and more engaging than the first edition. It
        commenced in the last week of January, and lasted for a duration of four months. Start
        Innovation Hub provided support, guidance, and mentorship to Akwa Ibom state based interns.
        As is customary, the interns learned to use technologies like Git, Docker, PHP, Continuous
        Integration, and UI/UX, with minimal guidance; this was in a bid to drive their instincts to
        excellence, and eventually bring out the best in participants.
        It would be recalled that the Hotels.ng internship programme, which first kicked off in August,
        2016 is a paid remote internship programme aimed at grooming software developers and UI/UX
        designers. The first remote internship programme, Internship 1.0, produced 170 strong interns
        who made a number of achievements; they built a Universal Locations API for e-commerce
        companies, and soon after, helped in completing spots.ng, a platform that suggests cool spots and
        tourist attractions in Nigeria, based on Users&#39; preferences. They also helped build two more
        programs - Raven, a simplified in-house mailing system, and Hotels.ng for businesses.
